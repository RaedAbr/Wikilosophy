# Wikilosophy
Is a project for a Web Mining and Big Data Analytics class at HES-SO Master. This project uses Wikipedia database which contains copies of all available content.

## Web Mining
### Objectifs
* Crawl the entirety of the English Wikipedia in this manner (code should be easily adaptable to other languages)
* Calculate an up-to-date estimate of how many pages lead to Philosophy
* Calculate connected components sizes
* Estimate average distance from a random page to Philosophy
* Graph visualisation if feasible


## Big Data Analytics
The aim is to provide statistics on Wikipedia pages. The set of statistics isn't fixed yet but includes:
* Compute the shortest path between two pages
* Find the bigest Hub (page with the largest number of outbound links) and the bigest Authority (page with the largest number of inbound links) by category
* Wikipedia words ranking
* Provide the next most likely word of a given word
